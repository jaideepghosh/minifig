## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer merge it for you.


## Branching Strategy
1. Always follow the recommended branching. *DO NOT MAKE DIRECT CHANGES IN THE main BRANCH*.
2. Use `feat` for feature, `fix` for defects, `hotfix` for small and high priority defects along with a short name of the branch. Eg: for new login feature, the name should be `feat/login`.
3. Open the PR from your feat/fix/hotfix branch to the `development` branch.
4. While creating a PR, please define the PR in the description and have a valid/meaningful PR title.
5. Delete your feat/fix/hotfix branch once the PR gets merged to the development branch.
